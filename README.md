These instructions are based on https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.4/installing/installing_bare_metal/installing-bare-metal.html

I have built this as a learning experience and potential use as a playground
environment for Systems Engineers who manage OpenShift clusters. At the end you
should end up with a OpenShift cluster with:

- One load-balancer/dhcp/dns system
- Three control-plane systems
- Three worker systems.


## Security

Don't expect this to be secure in any way. There are several thing in here that
I know to be insecure but this is for setting up a test environment. You have
been warned.

## Prerequisites

This walk-through makes a few assumptions. First of all you are going to need to
have at least a trial version of Openshift to be able to access everything.
Either contact you Red Hat representative and ask for a trial or you can sign up
for a Red Hat Developer account at https://developers.redhat.com/

The rest of the requirements are based on my working environment.

- Vagrant
- vagrant-libvirt
- Ansible


At the time of writing I was using Fedora 32 but this should work with minimal
modifications on other Linux distributions. You will also need a lot of RAM as
you are going to start up 8 virtual machines so the more RAM the better. If you
less than 64GB then you may want to edit the amount allocated to each machine
type in the `Vagrantfile`

You will also need some way of accessing the dns inside the cluster. This can
easily be done with NetworkManager and dnsmasq, an example of this is below.

    $ cat /etc/NetworkManager/conf.d/00-use-dnsmasq.conf
    # /etc/NetworkManager/conf.d/00-use-dnsmasq.conf
    #
    # This enabled the dnsmasq plugin.
    [main]
    dns=dnsmasq

    $ cat  /etc/NetworkManager/dnsmasq.d/00-config.conf
    server=192.168.1.1
    addn-hosts=/etc/hosts

    $  cat /etc/NetworkManager/dnsmasq.d/00-openshift.conf
    server=/kube1.vm.test/192.168.100.2

Remember to restart NetworkManager to pick up the changes.

    systemctl restart NetworkManager.service

The working directory for for all the commands is assumed to be the root
directory of the cloned git repository.




## Getting the cli tools and preparing




Make some directories to use.

    mkdir -p bin tmp ssh_key
    export PATH=${PWD}/bin/:$PATH

Generating an SSH keypair

    ssh-keygen -o -a 100 -t ed25519 -f ssh_key/id_ed25519  -C "example openshift key"


Obtaining a **Pull Secret** from the following URI and save it as
`./tmp/pull-secret.txt`

- https://cloud.redhat.com/openshift/install/pull-secret

Download the installation file on a local computer.

- https://cloud.redhat.com/openshift/install/metal/user-provisioned


    curl -Lo tmp/openshift-install-linux.tar.gz https://mirror.openshift.com/pub/openshift-v4/clients/ocp/latest/openshift-install-linux.tar.gz

Extract the installation program and put it somewhere on your PATH.


    tar xvf tmp/openshift-install-linux.tar.gz --directory tmp/
    mv tmp/openshift-install bin/

Download and extract the command line tool `oc` in the same place as you put
the installer.

    curl -Lo tmp/openshift-client-linux.tar.gz https://mirror.openshift.com/pub/openshift-v4/clients/ocp/latest/openshift-client-linux.tar.gz
    tar xvf tmp/openshift-client-linux.tar.gz --directory tmp/
    mv tmp/{oc,kubectl} bin/


Create an installation directory

    mkdir -p webroot/os_ignition

If you have used the directory before then you need to remove the old files.

    rm -rf webroot/os_ignition/*
    rm -rf webroot/os_ignition/.openshift*


## Creating the boot configs

Create an `install-config.yaml` inside the installation directory and customize
it as per the documentation on https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.4/installing/installing_bare_metal/installing-bare-metal.html#installation-bare-metal-config-yaml_installing-bare-metal
Note that you need to put your pull secret in there:

    cat <<-EOF > webroot/os_ignition/install-config.yaml
    apiVersion: v1
    baseDomain: vm.test
    compute:
    - hyperthreading: Enabled
      name: worker
      replicas: 0
    controlPlane:
      hyperthreading: Enabled
      name: master
      replicas: 3
    metadata:
      name: kube1
    networking:
      clusterNetwork:
      - cidr: 10.128.0.0/14
        hostPrefix: 23
      networkType: OpenShiftSDN
      serviceNetwork:
      - 192.168.101.0/24  # different to host network
    platform:
      none: {}
    fips: false
    pullSecret: '$(cat tmp/pull-secret.txt)'
    sshKey: '$(cat ssh_key/id_ed25519.pub)'
    EOF

You can add a corporate CA certificate and proxy servers in the
`install-config.yaml` if required:

    apiVersion: v1
    baseDomain: my.domain.com
    proxy:
        httpProxy: http://<username>:<pswd>@<ip>:<port>
        httpsProxy: http://<username>:<pswd>@<ip>:<port>
        noProxy: example.com
    additionalTrustBundle: |
        -----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----
        <MY_TRUSTED_CA_CERT>
        -----END CERTIFICATE-----

Creating the Kubernetes manifest and Ignition config files:

    openshift-install create manifests --dir=webroot/os_ignition

    sed -i 's/  mastersSchedulable: true/  mastersSchedulable: false/g' webroot/os_ignition/manifests/cluster-scheduler-02-config.yml

    openshift-install create ignition-configs --dir=webroot/os_ignition


XXXX TODO: besides the ignition files this also create the kubernetes
authentication files and they shouldn't be uploaded to a web servers.


Download the install images into `webroot/images/`:


    (
    cd webroot/images/
    curl -LO https://mirror.openshift.com/pub/openshift-v4/dependencies/rhcos/latest/latest/rhcos-4.4.3-x86_64-installer-kernel-x86_64
    curl -LO https://mirror.openshift.com/pub/openshift-v4/dependencies/rhcos/latest/latest/rhcos-4.4.3-x86_64-installer-initramfs.x86_64.img
    curl -LO https://mirror.openshift.com/pub/openshift-v4/dependencies/rhcos/latest/latest/rhcos-4.4.3-x86_64-metal.x86_64.raw.gz
    )


## The load-balancer system.



Start the first vagrant system that will provide the load-balancer and DHCP/DNS
services. In a production environment this would be a part of your infrastructure.
The following vagrant command should build the *lb* system and provision it using Ansible:

    vagrant up lb


The *lb* system is ready when you can access the HAProxy web
interface.

Username: test
Password: test

- http://192.168.100.2:8404/stats

You can access the *lb* system via vagrant:

    vagrant ssh lb


<!--
- https://traefik.192.168.100.2.xip.io:8443/dashboard/

Username:password is test:test or test1:test1
-->



## Building the Bootstrap system

Start a web server locally with `./webroot` as the root directory. The simplest
way is to use the webserver built into python. This web server serves the ipxe
configs and all the installation files. üî• the `./webroot/os_ignition/auth`
directory contains files that dont need to be and should never be accessable, I
have just been lazy here since it is a network local to wy workstation.

    python -m http.server --bind 192.168.100.1 --directory ./webroot 8000

Make sure that the virtual machines can access the web server through any
firewalls. On fedora use **firewall-cmd**

    sudo firewall-cmd --zone=libvirt --add-port=8000/tcp

Start the *bootstrap* system. This should ipxe boot over http.

    vagrant up bootstrap

After a short while you should see the following in the weblogs.

    Serving HTTP on 0.0.0.0 port 8000 (http://0.0.0.0:8000/) ...
    192.168.100.5 - - [22/Jun/2020 20:38:48] "GET /bootstrap.ipxe HTTP/1.1" 200 -

    192.168.100.5 - - [22/Jun/2020 20:39:03] "GET /images/rhcos-4.4.3-x86_64-metal.x86_64.raw.gz HTTP/1.1" 200 -


The *bootstrap* system is ready when it becomes available in the load-balancer
You can examine if the required services are available by looking at the
load-balancer stats page. Make sure that the *bootstrap* system is available in
both the `kubernetes_api` and `machine_config` backends. They should go green.



When it has finished installing you can ssh to the system using the ssh key
created earlier.

    ssh -i ssh_key/id_ed25519 core@192.168.100.5

    # to view the progress logs
    journalctl -b -f -u bootkube.service


## Control Plane systems and Worker systems
Start the rest of the systems. This requires 3 control plane (*cp*) systems and at
least 2 *worker* systems. The following commands will start these up three of
each.


    vagrant up /cp[0-9]/


    vagrant up /worker[0-9]/



You need to remove the *bootstrap* system when it has finished doing the initial
setup of the *cp* systems. The following command will monitor the
bootstrap progress and report when it is complete.



    $ openshift-install --dir=webroot/os_ignition wait-for bootstrap-complete --log-level=debug
    DEBUG OpenShift Installer 4.4.6
    DEBUG Built from commit 99e1dc030910ccd241e5d2563f27725c0d3117b0
    INFO Waiting up to 20m0s for the Kubernetes API at https://api.kube1.vm.test:6443...
    INFO API v1.17.1+f63db30 up
    INFO Waiting up to 40m0s for bootstrapping to complete...
    DEBUG Bootstrap status: complete
    INFO It is now safe to remove the bootstrap resources


You can also follow along the logs on the *bootstrap* system. After what feels
like a year the logs on *bootstrap* will have something like this appear.

    [core@bootstrap ~]$ journalctl -b -f -u bootkube.service

    Jun 22 21:20:58 bootstrap bootkube.sh[7751]: All self-hosted control plane components successfully started
    Jun 22 21:20:59 bootstrap bootkube.sh[7751]: Sending bootstrap-success event.Waiting for remaining assets to be created.
    # a whole lot more crap
    Jun 22 21:22:36 bootstrap bootkube.sh[7751]: bootkube.service complete


Destroy the *bootstrap* system

    vagrant destroy bootstrap

Looking in the HAProxy page http://192.168.100.2:8404/stats you will see that
the *cp* systems have all gone green and the *bootstrap* system is now red

## Access the cluster with `co`

    export KUBECONFIG=${PWD}/webroot/os_ignition/auth/kubeconfig


    $ watch -n5 oc get nodes
    NAME   STATUS   ROLES    AGE   VERSION
    cp0    Ready    master   26m   v1.17.1
    cp1    Ready    master   25m   v1.17.1
    cp2    Ready    master   25m   v1.17.1


For a new *worker* system to join the cluster it will need it's certificate
approved.  This can be automated in a cloud provider but for a bare-metal
cluster you need to do it by hand or automate it in some way. Keep an eye on
this while the workers are building as they have 2 sets of certificates which
need signing.


    $ watch -n5 oc get csr
    NAME        AGE   REQUESTOR                                                                   CONDITION
    csr-2vn2n   34m   system:node:cp2                                                             Approved,Issued
    csr-57kvs   35m   system:node:cp0                                                             Approved,Issued
    csr-8mhbr   34m   system:serviceaccount:openshift-machine-config-operator:node-bootstrapper   Approved,Issued
    csr-9wlf9   11m   system:serviceaccount:openshift-machine-config-operator:node-bootstrapper   Pending
    csr-dbrb2   10m   system:serviceaccount:openshift-machine-config-operator:node-bootstrapper   Pending
    csr-fh87f   10m   system:serviceaccount:openshift-machine-config-operator:node-bootstrapper   Pending
    csr-h5g2s   35m   system:serviceaccount:openshift-machine-config-operator:node-bootstrapper   Approved,Issued
    csr-kxxxg   34m   system:node:cp1                                                             Approved,Issued
    csr-tsw2q   34m   system:serviceaccount:openshift-machine-config-operator:node-bootstrapper   Approved,Issued

You can sign them one at a time but this does it all at once.

    oc get csr -o go-template='{{range .items}}{{if not .status}}{{.metadata.name}}{{"\n"}}{{end}}{{end}}' | xargs oc adm certificate approve




Watch the cluster operators start up.

    watch -n5 oc get clusteroperators

Eventually, everything go to *True* in the **AVAILABLE** column.

Use the following command to check when the install is completed.

    openshift-install --dir=webroot/os_ignition wait-for install-complete

The output will hang and wait for the installation to complete. Eventually you
should end up with output similar to the following:

    INFO Waiting up to 30m0s for the cluster at https://api.kube1.vm.test:6443 to initialize...
    INFO Waiting up to 10m0s for the openshift-console route to be created...
    INFO Install complete!
    INFO To access the cluster as the system:admin user when using 'oc', run 'export KUBECONFIG=/home/timhughes/git/vagrant_openshift/webroot/os_ignition/auth/kubeconfig'
    INFO Access the OpenShift web-console here: https://console-openshift-console.apps.kube1.vm.test
    INFO Login to the console with user: kubeadmin, password: xxxxx-xxxxx-xxxxx-xxxxx


## Access the web interface


- https://console-openshift-console.apps.kube1.vm.test

To login for the first time you should use the user `kubeadmin` and the password
shown in the last section. If you have missed that then it is available in the
configs you set up at the beginning.

    cat webroot/os_ignition/auth/kubeadmin-password
